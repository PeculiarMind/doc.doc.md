# Evaluation Matrix

The following matrix compares all considered implementation approaches across key decision criteria with weighted scoring (between 0 and 1) to facilitate an informed decision. The weighted score is calculated as (Score * Weight) for each criterion:

| Criterion | Weight | Approach A | Approach B | Approach C |
|-----------|--------|------------|------------|------------| 
| **Example Criterion 1** | 0.4 | ✓ <Rationale> | ~ <Rationale> | ✗ <Rationale> |
| **Weighted Score** | **/x** | **x.y** (n%) | **x.y** (n%) | **x.y** (n%) | **x.y** (n%) | **x.y** (n%) |


**Legend:**
- ✓ = Strength / Good fit (1.0 point)
- ~ = Acceptable / Trade-off (0.5 points)
- ✗ = Weakness / Poor fit (0.0 points)
- **Weighted Score** = Sum of (rating × weight) across all criteria
