## arc42

The architecture documentation structure in this project is based on the **arc42 template** for software architecture documentation.

arc42 provides a practical, proven template for documenting and communicating software and system architectures. It is structured into 12 sections covering everything from introduction and goals through building blocks, runtime views, deployment, and cross-cutting concepts to architecture decisions, quality requirements, and risks.
